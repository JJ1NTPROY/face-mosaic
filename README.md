## Introduction
We made a term project with the lecture notes that we used in our Open Sourse Software lectures.

We made an open source software that combines images of a puppy and a cat using openCV.
After combining images, we made it clear by controlling brightness of the image.

While working on this project, we thought about between dog pictures and cat pictures, but we didn't want to give up both, so we did a project to make both pictures come out on the screen. However, if you overlap the two pictures, the dog picture and the cat picture come out unnaturally, so I combined the two pictures because there was no space in the picture as naturally as possible. However, when you overlap two pictures with different colors, the colors come out messy, so when you overlap the two pictures, the colors are made black and white and the brightness is lowered. We proceeded with the project while looking at the lecture materials.
